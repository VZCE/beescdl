## Building / running from source

- Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) (and NPM)
- Git clone or download the ZIP from source code and extract.
- Install the package dependencies using `npm i` in the terminal.
- If you want to run the program from source code, type `npm run start`.
- If you want to *build* a portable program, run `npm run dist`. The resulting package will be found in a newly-created `dist` directory
